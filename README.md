# Twitter-Bot-Framework

The "yoobadooba" account that contributed is my alt Github, it's just that I no longer have access to it due to some stuff with the email; disregard that.

I might put some documentation into this another time, I just wanted to be able to show people something I developed around 2023-24. I controlled Twitter accounts with 6-7 digit follower counts with this stuff, but the code is probably obsolete by now. I know there's a private key there; I don't care, it is not that important to me.
